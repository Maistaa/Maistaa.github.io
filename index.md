# Proppy

**Proppy** is a multiplayer game developed in Unreal Engine 5 and inspired by Garry's Mod Prop Hunt. Players are divided into two teams: Props and Prop Hunters. The objective for the Props is to hide and survive as long as possible, while the Prop Hunters aim to locate and eliminate all Props. The game is played in rounds, providing a structured and competitive environment. 

**Proppy** will be available on [itch.io](https://itch.io) in Q1 2025, with potential future releases on Steam and the Epic Games Store.
